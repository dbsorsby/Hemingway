            <h2 class="text-center"><u>Interesting Facts</u></h2>
            <ul class="text-left" style="font-size: 13pt">
              <li>Many believe his mother wanted another girl, and so until Ernest was four his mother dressed him up like a girl.</li>
              <li>Ernest Hemingway’s brother founded a nation off the coast of Jamaica that consisted of a raft and 7 citizens. It had currency, postage, and a constitution.</li>
              <li>Irish Novelist James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway were drinking buddies in Paris. James would sometimes pick fights in Paris, then hide behind Hemingway shouting, “Deal with him, Hemingway! Deal with him!”.</li>
              <li>Francis Scott Fitzgerald once showed Hemingway his gentleman's part in a cafe bathroom, and confessed his worry that it was too small to satisfy his wife Zelda. Hemingway kindly reassured him it was ok.</li>
              <li>On the topic of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Scott wrote Hemingway a ten-page letter where he advised that he should end A Farewell to Arms with the passage: “The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those
                that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure that it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.” Hemingway wrote him three
                words back: “Kiss my ass.”</li>
              <li>Ernest stole a urinal from his favorite bar claiming that he had “pissed away” enough money into it that, as a result, he should own it. He ended up sticking the urinal in his house.</li>
              <li>American actor Orson Welles and Ernest Hemingway became great friends after getting into a fist-fight with each other in a theater.</li>
              <li>The longest sentence Hemingway ever wrote—in Green Hills of Africa—consisted of 424 words.</li>
              <li>In the 1940’s, Hemingway worked closely with the Soviet KGB. He went under the cover name “Argo.” Edgar Hoover and many FBI officials spied on him for much of his later life.</li>
              <li>During his life, Hemingway survived exposure to anthrax, malaria, skin cancer, and pneumonia. He lived through diabetes, two plane crashes, a ruptured kidney, hepatitis, a ruptured spleen, a fractured skull, a crushed vertebra, and the only
                thing he could not stop was himself. </li>
              <li>Ernest killed himself with his favorite shotgun, purchased from Abercrombie & Fitch. The newspapers called it “accidental”, however five years later his wife, Mary, publicly disclosed that the cause of death was suicide.</li>
